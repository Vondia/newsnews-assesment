<strong write a reflection about this assessment & your learning process in REFLECTION.md:>

First of all this was one of the biggest challenges i've had in a long long time.
And that was why i chose to go this route i wanted to challenge my self and boy did it work.
After the practice assignment i was quite stressed cause i needed help to get that done. After it was
finished though i was so so pleased but that only lasted 30 minutes until the real thing started haha.

<strong What did you do well, process wise:>

- i wrote a lot of good code without copying it from anywhere which then worked(and with worked i also count like the npm saying i did it succesfully even if it didnt work in the browser.) For me it just shows that slowly i'm learning the syntax and start to be able (for a very small amount) to express myself in code how i want to.
- I had to do a ton of debugging because as you'll read in the 'what i did wrong' part i didn't check myself enough. And that brought about a ton of error's most of which where link's werent working and therefor i got no data or just the using caps here and not using them there etc.
  Anyway i really improved my debugging skills :-).
- Perservered a ton not only spent a ton of hours on this but the little one got a fever tuesday during the day so had a lot less sleep as well. That plus being stuck and writing 100 different types of code to try and fix something is difficult and maddening at times haha.

<strong What would you do differently next time to improve, process wise>

- The moto check yourself before you wreck yourself is not for nothing. I knew this but still when you get the
  assisgnment it's so easy to go: "where did i do this before". And then when you find it copy it and start changing it
  around to fit the current assignment. The problem with this is that you often skip the very basic console logs to see if
  the basics are working. And boy did i learn that the hard way i've lost around 18 hours just because in the app.js i didnt have the
  /:id stuff and therefor it wasn't linked. So i wrote a ton of code to check if i could somehow get the data(i was convinced it didnt
  work because it was an object and before we worked with arrays. even though i saw in the api that it was an array of objects.). But i think this was the only way for me to truely learn to 'check myself before i wreck myself'. And it's not because i wouldnt believe it from the teachers it's just something that's best learned by pain haha. Just like when your parents say don't run on the ice and you're like yeah i can run on the ice... until you cant haha. Anyway this was a huge learning spot for me.

- giving code good different names is very important and this is something that i have to (and will) improve. This also entails using PascalCase and camelCase together which is just bad practice and can facilitate mistakes like typo's and wrong capitals etc. I've learned that this is an important part of being a good developer with a growth mind set.
